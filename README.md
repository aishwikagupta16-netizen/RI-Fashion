# RI-Fashion

A deep learning project for fashion image classification using the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
This repository contains the trained model, evaluation results, visualizations, and training history for the project.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying fashion items (such as shirts, shoes, bags, etc.) using a neural network model.
It includes:

-> Model training script

->Performance evaluation results

-> Training history data

-> Prediction visualizations
